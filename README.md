# Phrase-Match-In-Text
Its used to find how similar a phrase is to a part of a given text (It does not find which part of the text, it just gives you a number ranging from 0 to 1 telling you how similar it is)
I created that due to the low accuracy the difflib alone had when it came to finding a similar phrase inside a text (The difflib library is still used for part of it tho).
